Tagix enforces a structured approach to state management where state must be defined as discriminated unions. This constraint enables full TypeScript type inference, exhaustive pattern matching with compile-time safety, and automatic type narrowing throughout your application.

The library provides synchronous and asynchronous action creators with a fluent builder API, type-safe selectors with built-in memoization, and comprehensive error handling with structured error codes and analytics. All types are automatically inferred from your state definitions, eliminating manual type annotations while ensuring compile-time correctness.

> **Alert:** Tagix is currently in development and is not ready for production use.

> **Note:** This is an experimental project for learning and demonstration. It is not intended to compete with major state management libraries like Redux, Pinia, Zustand, Recoil, etc.
